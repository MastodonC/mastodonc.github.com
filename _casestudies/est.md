## The Scene
In order to hit environmental targets, UK buildings need to become dramatically more energy-efficient. However, we don't necessarily know which energy saving approaches work best in the real UK building stock we have today.

In order to learn more about what works, the Energy Saving Trust and their partners monitor retrofit schemes and trial new building approaches and technologies. They want to understand in fine detail how these technologies perform, at different times of day, with different occupancy levels, and in different weather conditions.

This will focus minds in a way that will not only improve the quality of treatment for patients but also reduce cost and > free up money for re-investment in other parts of the NHS.

## What We Did
To allow EST to make sense of these trials, we built and now operate and support our Hecuba system, which automatically accepts such trial data at 1 minute intervals, from a wide variety of sensors, and displays that data in a web-based interface which lets EST and its clients explore, graph, and calculate energy performance measures across a very wide and diverse range of indicators.

The system now contains:

- over 2,000 buildings;
- over 18,500 sensors;
- 850gb of data.

We provide EST with the customised system, systems admin support, security management, and all the other support which allows us to continue ingesting and making sense of huge quantities of real time data.

This was a great experiment for our Kixi open-source data platform, on which Hecuba is based, to flex its muscle and use some - at times - tricky data structures and sets to make sense of it all. Like all of our projects, this was run in an agile manner and continues to make use of and add to state of the art open source technology.
