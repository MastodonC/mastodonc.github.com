So it's almost a month since we made the beta version of Mastodon C which won the AMEE <a href="http://london.greenhackathon.com/hacks/mastodon/">London Green Hackathon 2012</a>, and seems like the excitement just keeps building. We are incredibly excited about the potential of our project  - we really could make cloud computing significantly greener with this.

We entered the Digital London Challenge to get some early funding and support. If you like us then please <a href="https://startupchallenge.wazoku.com/entry/d81452bc45598af34bc88c5f38b29456">vote </a><a href="https://startupchallenge.wazoku.com/entry/d81452bc45598af34bc88c5f38b29456">vote </a><a href="https://startupchallenge.wazoku.com/entry/d81452bc45598af34bc88c5f38b29456">vote</a>!

We've also been getting fantastic comments and support from some especially grand people.

James Governor, of <a href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/monkchips/status/170528336383193088">said</a>:
<blockquote><em><a href="http://www.mastodonc.com/">Mastodon C</a> is arguably the most important project in IT today - energy efficiency for hadoop, the future of data</em></blockquote>
The London Green Hackathon judges said:
<blockquote><em>Mastodon looks to the future of distributed computing, and is a great example of web-meets-cleantech.</em></blockquote>
And, my personal favourite quote, from @mrchrisadams:
<blockquote><em>Herds of intelligent roaming hadoop jobs, migrating from datacentre to datacentre, in search of cold iron in a Gibsonian future</em>.</blockquote>
