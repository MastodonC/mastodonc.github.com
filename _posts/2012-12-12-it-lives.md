We've finally published the prescribing analytics portal <a href="http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/">here</a>
<!--more-->

It covers prescribing variation of statins in the UK last year, making it really easy to explore variation which could be costing extra money. I definitely recommend taking a look - it's fascinating to explore.

It got some great coverage too - the Financial Times, the Economist, and Huffington Post all had approving mentions.

Last week, the NHS Information Centre released another <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/prescribing">quarter of a billion rows of data</a>, so there's a lot more to be done here, and this kind of big data is exactly our bag. Watch this space!
