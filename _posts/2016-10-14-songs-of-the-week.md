## Monday

Eleonore was glad we survived the weekend and chose
a [Destiny's Child cover](https://youtu.be/uipKPIlEVGg). She then
followed that up with
a [Rihanna cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE5DbnAkb1w).

Seb's afternoon was improved by
[Bowie's Golden Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKUy6ygUgP0)
and Elise went with
[Walrus by D.D Dumbo](https://soundcloud.com/d-d-dumbo/walrusofficial).

Sunny rounded out the afternoon with The Lonond Gay Men's Chorus singing
[Go West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAOtgQwwYIY).

## Tuesday

Sunny went with
[MOH! KOUYATÉ - "Yéllé"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps23XEV_bpo)
as SOTD.

I then followed up
with
