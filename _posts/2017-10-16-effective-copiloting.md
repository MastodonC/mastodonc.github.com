I've previously written about Mastodon C's affinity for ['*plural programming*'](http://www.mastodonc.com/remote%20working/company/engineering/2017/07/21/we-work-together.html). In this blog post I'd like to follow up with some ideas and thoughts I've collected about the minutiae of this technique, specifically the expectations of being a "co-pilot".

Make no mistake, having one or more effective co-pilots is important to successful plural programming. We can see this simply by understanding the core goals behind the practice:

- **Knowledge sharing** - The intricate details of a system no longer exist inside a single person's brain. The [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is reduced.
- **Quality of code** - Feedback about approach and implementation is no longer theoretical, and the code is more maintainable and understandable as a result.
- **Reduced likelihood of bugs** - With shared understanding and more eyes on the code at the time of writing, the process of debugging is accelerated and some bugs are prevented entirely.
- **Building trust and confidence** - Not only in the code base and application, *but also in your coworkers*.

In order to achieve any of these goals, the onus is on the team, not just the "driver" or any single person involved in the session.

### Being Effective

I've had the privilege of programming alongside a wide variety of programmers. I've tried to reflect on both the times I felt well-supported, and the times I felt my support was being best received and contributed to productive sessions. Here are some things that stood out to me:

### The Setup

Plural programming at Mastodon C is most often done remotely. We use tools like [Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) and [tmate](https://tmate.io/). Participating at our own workstations (as opposed to in the same room, in-front of a single workstation) grants a greater degree of asynchronicity
