We had the big launch this week for the <a href="http://www.cde.org.uk/">Open Health Data Platform</a>, at <a href="http://shoreditchworks.com/shoreditch-village-hall/">Shoreditch Village Hall</a>. It seemed like the audience agreed with us that there was plenty of good stuff to be done with open health data:

We've built the platform on behalf of <a href="https://cde.catapult.org.uk/">Connected Digital Economy Catapult</a>, along with <a href="http://www.errorstudio.co.uk/">Error Creative Studio</a> who did the work to make it beautiful. The Platform is really a collection of examples, how-tos, and case studies for using open health data to build useful analytics and applications: everything there, including both code and design, is open source and open access, and intended for people to reuse and remix for their own purposes.

The Catapult are now really keen to take this forward with more examples, and to support health tech entrepreneurs as well as bigger organisations and the public and voluntary sectors to do good things with this data, so if you're interested in the area you should definitely <a href="http://www.cde.org.uk/getinvolved/">stay in touch</a>.
