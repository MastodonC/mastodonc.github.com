Smarter use of city data is helping bustling metropolitan areas be better places to live. From generating useful insights in complex areas, to developing new public services, data is creating a new kind of infrastructure that’s growing to be as essential to successful city living as roads and utilities.

On the 17th May, Mastodon C, with a group of fellow urban innovators, will be sharing insights into the data products and services that have been built over the past three years to address the problems towns and cities face. As well as sharing our stories, and showcasing what we have created, the event is a chance to explore what the future might hold for data driven innovation in cities. We’d love it if you joined us. Space is limited so book your place [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/third-thursday-the-march-toward-advanced-data-capability-in-our-cities-tickets-45190477936?utm_campaign=New%20Witan%20Campaign&utm_source=Blog).
