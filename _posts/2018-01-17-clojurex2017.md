ClojureX in London was fun and interesting. The event is a great opportunity to hear a range of people in the community share their ideas and experience - from colleagues in the data science consulting world, to authors of essential new tools and libraries, to new start-ups. The development of Clojurescript has attracted fresh faces from the javascript world which added something new to the event. I always enjoy seeing the Clojure community being so active and diverse.

This blog contains a small list of the talks I found interesting and thought might be useful to share.

## How I bled all over Onyx

Mastodon C data engineer[ Jason Bell](http://www.mastodonc.com/about/) [shares his experiences with the Onyx framework](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10939-how-i-bled-all-over-onyx) in a year when he pushed it to the limits.

## Clojure for data science: implementing a natural language processing pipeline

[From a prototype in python to clojure in production](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10940-clojure-for-data-science-from-a-prototype-in-python-to-clojure-in-production): this is an interesting use case of a big data text (topic) analysis pipeline.

## Want to know some of the common traps and pitfalls in Clojure?

[Clojure Puzzlers](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10937-clojure-puzzlers): a collection of weird and wondrous Clojure edge cases, worth a watch.

## The next giant leap in Clojure’s reach

[Lumo: bootstrapping a standalone clojurescript environment](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10833-keynote-lumo-bootstrapping-a-standalone-clojurescript-environment): I haven’t used Lumo, but this was an interesting and Clojure script heavy description of why Lumo is very cool.

## a framework for building server-side applications in Clojure

[Productive Duct](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10836-productive-duct), James Reeves’ latest Devops Clojurescript, is a web framework. I’m in two mind about this, because I don’t like frameworks much, but when you think of it [Components](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) is kind of a framework too. This could make Duct useful as a light-weight if limited (for now) replacement.

## refactoring systems to make changes easier, safer, faster

[Taming a huge, sprawling system with Clojure](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10938-taming-a-huge-sprawling-system-with-clojure) is somewhat relevant to our work at Mastodon C.  This talk tells the story of a team that grew to a crazy numbers of microsystems and then had to review everything to make life more manageable.

## mach and Roll

We’ve just started using mach in our team, so it was interesting to watch Jon Pither from Juxt explain how they use terraform, and describe their mach, roll and edge tools in his [Devops Clojurescript: One config to rule them all](https://href.li/?https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11035-devops-clojurescript-one-config-to-rule-them-all) talk.

## bringing the Clojure data science ecosystem back to life

Finally, I gave a talk on the "[Return of Clojure Data Science](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10776-keynote-the-return-of-clojure-data-science)", and the efforts we’re making at Mastodon C to support the continued development of the language through open source libraries.
