We've got a nice project which went live today - we've been providing the final performance analysis for the £17m government-funded Retrofit for the Future programme, which has been running since 2009. The programme retrofitted 120 homes in the UK with multiple energy-saving and energy-efficiency technologies, and collected data through over 1300 sensors and meters taking readings every 5 minutes. The aim of the programme was to inform the planning and development of retrofit and new-build homes to help the UK meet its energy goals. They launched the final results at Ecobuild today, and they're also up on <a href="http://www.retrofitanalysis.org/">this website</a>.

As you might imagine, that many meter readings accumulate into a dataset which is pretty big, and it's been a lot of fun trying to wrangle it into shape. The sensors have come in all shapes and sizes, and all levels of reliability, so (as always) a major part of the work has been in cleaning and making sense of the data, before actually being able to do a lot with it. The good news is that the results are great - an average reduction in emissions of over 60%, with some homes reducing by more than 80% (fivefold!). There's also a load more we could do with the same dataset - we haven't even begun to dig into the behavioural and other factors that are revealed by this very fine-grained information.

So for now, take a look at <a href="http://www.retrofitanalysis.org/">the report</a>, and you can register to gain your own access to the raw data at https://est.amee.com/. We'll be releasing the analysis code shortly, as well. <a title="the report" href="http://www.retrofitanalysis.org/">
