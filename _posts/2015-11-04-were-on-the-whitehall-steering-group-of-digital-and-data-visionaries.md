It was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/open-data-institute-summit-2015-matt-hancock-speech">announced yesterday</a> that Fran, our CEO, will be on the new steering group of "digital and data visionaries" helping the UK government become more and more data-driven. We're obviously very excited about this - both because it's an honour to be asked to participate, and because we're genuinely keen toÂ put data to work in a way that really affects our lives for the better.
