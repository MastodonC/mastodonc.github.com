<p>We need test pilots! </p>
<!--more-->
<p>We have a free low-carbon cloud recommendation service ready in private beta, and need existing Hadoop users to try it out. Even if you only use AWS, we can still find you the best AWS location for your job - there are huge differences in emissions even just between US East and US West. </p><p>Would you be interested, or know someone who would? If so, please do contact us from www.mastodonc.com. </p>
