Looks like Infinity DC are<a href="http://www.infinitysdc.net/inovation/"> building a biomass-powered data centre near London</a>.

This is great news: they'll be the first one to do green-powered data centres in the UK. A couple of others are using offsetting but we've not heard yet of anyone else directly powering off a green source, which is much preferable.

Any current cloud providers fancy putting a public cloud resource in there? We'd love to add it to the menu for our clients - right now, Greenqloud in Iceland are the only other ones we know of, and we've got plenty of people who need to be UK-based but who would prefer to use fully green resources.
