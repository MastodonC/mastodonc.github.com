## Who we are

Mastodon C are agile big data specialists. We offer the open source
technology platform and the skills to help our clients realise the
potential of their data. We work in particular in applying data to
areas where we think we can have a positive impact on the world.

## Responsibilities

You will be supporting the development of our major new product Witan,
which aims to use big data, open data, and analytics technologies to
improve city planning.

Your main responsibility will be identifying, documenting, and
gathering together key public datasets which support cities in solving
their planning problems. This will involve desk research, discussion
with our data science team, and some technical work cleaning the data
and loading it into our platform.

You will work day-to-day with the software development team, business
team, and our data science consulting team, who you will collaborate with to
design and implement solutions both within Witan and in other
projects.

## Who you are

Our ideal person for this role would:

 - Have or be working towards at least Bachelors level degree in a
   numerate subject, or be very comfortable with working with data.
 - Be confident and comfortable doing online research in a systematic
   way.
 - Be excited to share their knowledge with the team, and keen to work
   in a collaborative environment
 - Be detail-oriented and accurate in their work
 - Have good communication skills - able to listen to colleagues and
   clients and understand their challenges and goals, able to
   communicate complex structures and models to non-technical users
 - Be interested in and excited about applying data and analytics to
   important issues in the world

## Salary and work environment

We are a data science consultancy based in Bermondsey, London. We’re happy to discuss part-remote
or part-time arrangements if those are important for you.

We’re a small and very consultative and interactive team, which means
that every member has a big influence on how things run and has a lot
of control over the way they work.

This is a 12-week internship opportunity, paying the London Living
Wage.

If this looks like your kind of a role, please contact us at
theteam@mastodonc.com with a CV and we’ll talk.

Please note that you need to be eligible to work in the UK to apply
for this position.

No agents please.
