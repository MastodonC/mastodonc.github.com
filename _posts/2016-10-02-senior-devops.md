This is a senior role, based either in our London office or at your remote location within the UK. The base salary for this role will be between £50-60k pa. We are happy to consider part-time or flexible working proposals.

You will be responsible for shaping and delivering the infrastructure aspects of the new Witan city modelling and data platform product, as part of a very collaborative, flexible, and high-performing startup team. The project is funded by Innovate UK until 2018, and uses the Greater London Authority as a test bed.

Here is what you can expect to be working with

- Mesos
- Docker
- Onyx
- Spark
- Hadoop
- Kafka
- Cassandra
- Zookeeper
- Microservices
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Alerting

You will be the lead on making sure these technologies are working well for us, and that we can build applications on top of them. While the whole team is responsible for all development and operations, we are looking for someone with a strong operations background to be the expert in the team and to share their knowledge and experience with everyone to make the team stronger.

We believe in being friendly, supportive and open and we produce and contribute to Free and Open Source software whenever we can.

What you have experience with:

- AWS EC2 and related technologies
- Some form of devops automation (terraform, puppet, chef, ansible, other)
- GNU/Linux and deploying GNU/Linux in production environments
- Automating deployments
- Monitoring systems
- Communicating and explaining to the team and to potential and existing clients and users.


What you will learn:

- AWS
- Terraform
- Clojure and Clojurescript
- Mesos
- Docker
- Onyx
- Spark
- Hadoop
- Microservices
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Alerting

Knowledge and experience of any of these will be an advantage, but everyone on the team will learn more of all of the above by working together.

## Who we are

We're a team of 11 people, with 8 of us working mostly on the tech side of things. Among the tech team, our professional experiences span from 1+ year to 15+ years, but we're all excited by working in Clojure! Four team members work remotely, but drop by London for occasional meetings and our twice-yearly offsite.

You can see what we’ve built before in the following locations:

- [Witan](https://witan-alpha.mastodonc.com)
- [Hecuba/getembed](https://www.getembed.com)
- Almost all of our code on [github](https://github.com/MastodonC)
