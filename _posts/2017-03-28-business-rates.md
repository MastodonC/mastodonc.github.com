Trials starting in April will see local authorities increase the share
of revenues they retain from business rates. This offers opportunities
to better manage, forecast and shape revenues, which will interest
anyone involved in planning the future of our communities -  from
local authority leaders who want to maximise revenues, to property
developers who want to show the economic benefits of their plans.  But
the truth is, it’s not going to be easy.

With support from Innovate UK, Mastodon C are looking for partners to
explore the potential for a data science led approach to forecasting
and planning for revenues, using Witan, our city planning and data
sharing platform. In May Mastodon C will host a workshop to discuss
ways that the platform could be used to ensure local communities get
the most from the changes.

If you’d like to get involved please email theteam@mastodonc.com.
We’re looking for input from anyone interested in this area, as well
as potential hosts for the event.
