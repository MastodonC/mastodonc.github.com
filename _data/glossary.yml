  - term: Data
    definition: “A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)). Information in raw form (such as alphabets, numbers, or symbols) that refer to, or represent, conditions, ideas, or objects.  In the context of computing data can be thought of as information that is transmitted or stored.
  - term: Database
    definition: A digital collection of data and the structure around which the data is organized.
  - term: Data Science
    definition: Data science is an interdisciplinary exercise that aims to find useful answers and insights in data by combining mathematical, scientifically robust approaches with computer programming techniques.
  - term: Data Mining
    definition: Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems.
  - term: Deep Learning
    definition: Deep Learning involves feeding a computer system a lot of data, which it can use to make decisions ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/12/08/what-is-the-difference-between-deep-learning-machine-learning-and-ai/#1806d0c826cf)). A subset of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning develops networks which are capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as Deep Neural Learning or Deep Neural Network ([Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deep-learning.asp)).
E:
  - term: ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)
    definition: A process in database and data warehousing meaning extracting the data from outside sources, transforming it to fit operational needs, and loading it into a database.
F:
  - term: Formats
    definition: How data is structured and stored.
G:
  - term: GIS
    definition: A geographic information system (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data.
  - term: Governance
    definition: The processes, policies and tools that ensure data is formally managed, so that an organisation meets policy, legal, statutory, requirements, and so data can serve the mission and goals of an organisation.
H:
  - term: Hadoop
    definition: An open-source software framework used for storage and processing of (typically) large datasets.
I:
  - term: IOT - Internet of Things
    definition: The connection of ordinary, everyday devices to the internet. Connection of everyday physical objects and products to the Internet so that they can relate to other systems or their data can be used and analysed.

K: false
L:
  - term: Linked Data
    definition: A method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful.
  - term: Licensing
    definition: Data licensing is what tells someone what they can and can’t legally do with a piece of data or software.
M:
  - term: Metadata
    definition: A set of data that describes and gives information about what other data is about.
  - term: Machine Learning
    definition: A subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
  - term: Model
    definition: An abstract construct that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of real world entities.
N:
  - term: Natural Language Processing
    definition: Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with using computers to make sense of human language.
O:
  - term: Open Data
    definition: Data that anyone can access, use and share, for any purpose, without cost.
  - term: Open Source
    definition: Software for which the original source code or information is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified in various ways depending on its licence.
P:
  - term: Predictive Analytics
    definition: Using data to predict what will happen next - for example what someone is likely to buy or visit, or how something will behave.
  - term: Data Platform
    definition: A place where data is published for use by others.
  - term: Python
